## Postgres Database from [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) ðŸš€

[Migrated from Heroku](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/getting-started/migrate-from-heroku/)

Connect to your database instance to run queries (ex. \dt).

```sh
fly pg connect -a <postgres-app-name> -d <db-name>
```

The
[local connection](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-with-flyctl/)
to the database should first be enabled by tunneling the localhost port 5432.
The command must be left running while the database is used. So do not close the
console!

```sh
flyctl proxy 5432 -a <postgres-app-name>
```

The Fly.io connect-string is of the form:

`DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:<password>@localhost:5432/<db-name>`
